# Marvel Rivals Bayesian W/L Tracker 🎮📊

## Description
This is a **personal tracker** for my **Season 1 Ranked** matches in Marvel Rivals.  
The goal is to **update my expected win-loss ratio** dynamically using **Bayesian statistics**.

## Features
- 🏆 **Tracks total matches played**
- 📈 **Calculates updated win probability using Bayesian inference**
- 📊 **Visualizes posterior distributions over time**
- 🔄 **Weekly updates with new match data**

## How It Works
1. Start with a prior belief about my **true win probability**.
2. Each time I play new matches, I update my **posterior probability**.
3. This gives a **more accurate win rate prediction** over time.

## 📊 Current Stats
| Week | Matches Played | Wins | Losses | Expected Win % |
|------|--------------|------|--------|---------------|
| 1    | 96          | 52   | 44     | 54.2%         |
